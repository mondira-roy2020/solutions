# Creating a Monster

* **Objective** - To define several subclasses of a `Monster`.
* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with inheritance and polymorphism
* **Description**
    * We have many types of monsters that can attack.
    * We shall design a superclass called `Monster` and define the method named `attack()` in the superclass.
    * The subclasses shall then provides their actual implementation.
    * Ensure that all test cases in `src.test.com.github.perscholas` pass with 100% success rate.
